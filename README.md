# adventofcode


## 2021
Decided to use C++ (did a course recently on C++ to brush up and realized I needed more brushing up).

### Pre-requisistes
- G++  8.4.0
- cmake 3.20.0

I used vscode for editing and debugging.

### Notes
This has deliberately not been polished, it is in the exact same state I left it in when I completed each puzzle.
There are probably tons of leaks, some of which I know about, the rest I don't care, these little programs are short lived, had they been more demanding, I would 
have paid more attention to that sort of thing.

I stopped solving the puzzles on day 15 part2. I could have continued but needed to put time into other things especially around the Christmas time

## 2022
Decided to use both rust and scala 3. Main focus being rust but wanted to use scala as well. (JDK 17 as JDK for scala)
